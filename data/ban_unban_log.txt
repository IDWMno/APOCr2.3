ShadowRider1/(Me'ira Ax'el) perma-jobbanned AardvarkPlatter/(Luca Faust) from Head of Personnel. reason: The Captain made the clown an HOP, and the RD disagreed with it.

The RD got beaten to 30 Brute Damage, by the Captain, while running from the crew. The Captain illegally detained the RD, because he disagreed with them, and then beat him said-damage, before searching him and taking/finding his traitor items he should've never gotten.
